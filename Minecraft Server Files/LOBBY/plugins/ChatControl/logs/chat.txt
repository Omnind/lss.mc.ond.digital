[27.08.2020 13:54:10] Stefytorus: made 3 ranks
[27.08.2020 13:54:13] Stefytorus: Player, Mod, Disclosure
[27.08.2020 13:54:13] BlockWorksYT: kk
[27.08.2020 13:54:15] BlockWorksYT: Perfect.
[27.08.2020 13:54:25] Stefytorus: crates are almost done
[27.08.2020 13:54:32] BlockWorksYT: I'll do the spawn now ☺
[27.08.2020 13:54:36] Stefytorus: great
[27.08.2020 13:54:42] Stefytorus: how does that look>?
[27.08.2020 13:54:58] BlockWorksYT: No y co'ordinate?
[27.08.2020 13:55:03] Stefytorus: they fall down
[27.08.2020 13:55:05] Stefytorus: tp
[27.08.2020 13:55:06] BlockWorksYT: Ah sure.
[27.08.2020 13:55:09] BlockWorksYT: No access.
[27.08.2020 13:55:15] Stefytorus: tp
[27.08.2020 13:55:23] BlockWorksYT: yeah looks great
[27.08.2020 13:55:31] Stefytorus: i need to fine tune the design a bit
[27.08.2020 13:55:57] BlockWorksYT: now what?
[27.08.2020 13:56:06] Stefytorus: the chicken didn't despawn
[27.08.2020 13:56:11] Stefytorus: i need to find out why
[27.08.2020 13:56:15] BlockWorksYT: cool
[27.08.2020 13:56:20] BlockWorksYT: can we rename it to 'DiscCrate'
[27.08.2020 13:56:24] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 13:56:26] BlockWorksYT: since it has music discs
[27.08.2020 13:56:26] BlockWorksYT: cool
[27.08.2020 13:56:31] BlockWorksYT: also server name is still UCL I think
[27.08.2020 13:57:29] Stefytorus: yep, copied the core plugins from there
[27.08.2020 13:57:34] Stefytorus: where did you see UCL?
[27.08.2020 13:57:35] BlockWorksYT: cool
[27.08.2020 13:57:38] Stefytorus: so i can remove it
[27.08.2020 13:58:10] BlockWorksYT: weird
[27.08.2020 13:58:16] BlockWorksYT: is this schematic pasted in higher?
[27.08.2020 13:58:20] Stefytorus: yes
[27.08.2020 13:58:23] Stefytorus: no space
[27.08.2020 13:58:25] Stefytorus: ?
[27.08.2020 13:58:30] BlockWorksYT: hmm wanted the spawn much higher
[27.08.2020 13:58:38] Stefytorus: we can move it lower if you want
[27.08.2020 13:58:44] BlockWorksYT: yeah if that's ok?
[27.08.2020 13:58:47] Stefytorus: should be, yes
[27.08.2020 13:58:53] Stefytorus: can you move it?
[27.08.2020 13:59:31] BlockWorksYT: .//move is always buggy
[27.08.2020 13:59:35] Stefytorus: hmm
[27.08.2020 13:59:38] BlockWorksYT: don't want to break it...
[27.08.2020 13:59:40] Stefytorus: just delete and paste again
[27.08.2020 13:59:48] Stefytorus: it's called disclosure_map_large
[27.08.2020 13:59:57] Stefytorus: it will give some errors about corruption
[27.08.2020 13:59:58] BlockWorksYT: kk, where is it copied from?
[27.08.2020 13:59:58] Stefytorus: ignore that
[27.08.2020 14:00:15] Stefytorus: copied it yesterday from bw
[27.08.2020 14:00:24] BlockWorksYT: I mean like which block?
[27.08.2020 14:00:25] BlockWorksYT: height
[27.08.2020 14:00:31] Stefytorus: bottom corner
[27.08.2020 14:00:36] BlockWorksYT: perfect, thanks
[27.08.2020 14:00:40] Stefytorus: 0 0 0
[27.08.2020 14:01:11] BlockWorksYT: just want to check the clubs first
[27.08.2020 14:01:47] BlockWorksYT: hmm chunk rendering is quite slow?
[27.08.2020 14:01:58] Stefytorus: view distance is 16
[27.08.2020 14:01:59] Stefytorus: that's why
[27.08.2020 14:02:10] BlockWorksYT: can we do 32?
[27.08.2020 14:02:25] Stefytorus: that's not vanilla, we can try
[27.08.2020 14:02:28] Stefytorus: but it will only worsen the issue
[27.08.2020 14:02:36] BlockWorksYT: ok
[27.08.2020 14:02:55] BlockWorksYT: do you know which bottom corner? east/west etc.
[27.08.2020 14:03:03] Stefytorus: tp to 0, 0, 0
[27.08.2020 14:03:13] Stefytorus: i pasted it at 0 80 0 previously
[27.08.2020 14:03:18] BlockWorksYT: cool
[27.08.2020 14:03:48] BlockWorksYT: Worldedit action was cancelled
[27.08.2020 14:04:02] Stefytorus: do you want me to try?
[27.08.2020 14:04:02] BlockWorksYT: ah gotta bypass WEA
[27.08.2020 14:04:04] BlockWorksYT: got it
[27.08.2020 14:05:11] BlockWorksYT: kk lets try now
[27.08.2020 14:05:27] BlockWorksYT: schem name again?
[27.08.2020 14:05:36] Stefytorus: disclosure_map_large
[27.08.2020 14:07:35] Stefytorus: is it better now?
[27.08.2020 14:08:39] BlockWorksYT: think we're good now :)
[27.08.2020 14:18:25] BlockWorksYT: hey stef
[27.08.2020 14:19:47] Stefytorus: was afk
[27.08.2020 14:19:52] BlockWorksYT: np :)
[27.08.2020 14:19:56] BlockWorksYT: can't seem to get the soundtrack to play?
[27.08.2020 14:19:59] BlockWorksYT: might be an RP issue
[27.08.2020 14:20:09] Stefytorus: ah, that's not finished yet
[27.08.2020 14:20:11] Stefytorus: good point
[27.08.2020 14:20:18] BlockWorksYT: is that RP or server?
[27.08.2020 14:20:24] BlockWorksYT: the discs are working, but not correctly named
[27.08.2020 14:20:44] Stefytorus: what version are you on?
[27.08.2020 14:20:47] BlockWorksYT: 1/16/1
[27.08.2020 14:20:55] Stefytorus: uhh
[27.08.2020 14:21:00] Stefytorus: i'll need to fix
[27.08.2020 14:24:58] BlockWorksYT: brb
[27.08.2020 14:38:31] Stefytorus: music works
[27.08.2020 14:43:30] BlockWorksYT: so this is pretty much spawn lol
[27.08.2020 14:43:34] BlockWorksYT: i'll add some more holos
[27.08.2020 14:43:38] Stefytorus: lol
[27.08.2020 14:43:43] BlockWorksYT: disccrate message - need to make sure it says 'A disc crate'
[27.08.2020 14:43:46] BlockWorksYT: not disco crate
[27.08.2020 14:44:29] Stefytorus: done
[27.08.2020 14:44:54] BlockWorksYT: yeah nice
[27.08.2020 14:44:54] Stefytorus: maybe like this?
[27.08.2020 14:45:04] BlockWorksYT: so there are 5 locations in the world to reach jukeboxes
[27.08.2020 14:45:14] BlockWorksYT: if we give players /spawn then they don't have to spend ages finding the jukeboxes
[27.08.2020 14:45:31] BlockWorksYT: noice :)
[27.08.2020 14:45:41] Stefytorus: issue with jukeboxes at spawn is they will battle to see who can place the disc
[27.08.2020 14:45:48] BlockWorksYT: can we give each player compass and elytra on spawn
[27.08.2020 14:45:53] Stefytorus: yes
[27.08.2020 14:45:58] BlockWorksYT: yeah, maybe we have a cooldown?
[27.08.2020 14:45:59] Stefytorus: do you want the players to wear the elytra?
[27.08.2020 14:46:04] BlockWorksYT: yes please
[27.08.2020 14:46:09] Stefytorus: and maybe put the compass on their head
[27.08.2020 14:46:14] Stefytorus: and make them unremovables
[27.08.2020 14:46:30] BlockWorksYT: didn't know compasses can go on their heads?
[27.08.2020 14:46:54] BlockWorksYT: have we got day / night cycle?
[27.08.2020 14:47:03] Stefytorus: you can make anything go anywhere with plugins
[27.08.2020 14:47:13] Stefytorus: i disbled it since we didn't really have any light sources
[27.08.2020 14:47:17] Stefytorus: disabled*
[27.08.2020 14:47:18] BlockWorksYT: how do I activate the disc crate?
[27.08.2020 14:47:19] Stefytorus: but we can enable it
[27.08.2020 14:47:26] Stefytorus: i need to implement the key functionality
[27.08.2020 14:47:42] Stefytorus: and then we need to hide key chests around the map
[27.08.2020 14:47:51] BlockWorksYT: ah
[27.08.2020 14:47:55] BlockWorksYT: that might be too difficult
[27.08.2020 14:48:03] Stefytorus: hiding key chests?
[27.08.2020 14:48:04] BlockWorksYT: unless we have loads
[27.08.2020 14:48:11] Stefytorus: we can make them respawn
[27.08.2020 14:48:30] BlockWorksYT: kk i'll start adding
[27.08.2020 14:48:36] Stefytorus: wait, don't yet
[27.08.2020 14:48:37] BlockWorksYT: can I just add chests and automatically they'll have keys spawn in?
[27.08.2020 14:48:44] Stefytorus: i need to add a plugind
[27.08.2020 14:50:01] Stefytorus: here we go
[27.08.2020 14:50:44] Stefytorus: tp
[27.08.2020 14:50:54] Stefytorus: when you place a chest, make sure to link it
[27.08.2020 14:50:58] Stefytorus: ./loot link KeyChest
[27.08.2020 14:51:00] Stefytorus: while looking at it
[27.08.2020 14:51:04] BlockWorksYT: great, thanks
[27.08.2020 14:55:03] Stefytorus: we need a help
[27.08.2020 14:55:39] Stefytorus: and then some queue or cooldown system for music
[27.08.2020 14:55:47] Stefytorus: so people don't kick eachother out their music listening sessions
[27.08.2020 14:55:51] BlockWorksYT: yea
[27.08.2020 14:55:53] BlockWorksYT: 2 mins?
[27.08.2020 14:56:16] BlockWorksYT: I think we need other loot
[27.08.2020 14:56:24] BlockWorksYT: speed and jump boosts
[27.08.2020 14:56:28] BlockWorksYT: as it takes so long to travel
[27.08.2020 15:02:46] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 15:02:55] Stefytorus: if you want create the items
[27.08.2020 15:03:06] Stefytorus: and add them to /loot gui (KeyCrate)
[27.08.2020 15:03:09] Stefytorus: and add them to /loot gui KeyCrate
[27.08.2020 15:03:18] Stefytorus: KeyChest*
[27.08.2020 15:15:33] Stefytorus: do you think this works?
[27.08.2020 15:15:46] Stefytorus: and they can E to see where to go
[27.08.2020 15:19:30] Stefytorus: d
[27.08.2020 15:23:41] Stefytorus: did you get any more news about the presentation project?
[27.08.2020 15:30:56] Stefytorus: also, for the jukebox, wouldn't it be better if we actually just make a virtual jukebox
[27.08.2020 15:31:30] Stefytorus: actually nvm
[27.08.2020 15:31:34] Stefytorus: that wouldn't allow people to listen to it
[27.08.2020 15:36:35] Stefytorus: can you help me test for a second ?
[27.08.2020 15:41:34] Stefytorus: i Think you placed more than enough
[27.08.2020 15:42:01] Stefytorus: 288
[27.08.2020 15:42:09] BlockWorksYT: lol sorry
[27.08.2020 15:42:10] BlockWorksYT: in a call atm
[27.08.2020 15:42:13] BlockWorksYT: so just running around placing
[27.08.2020 15:42:17] Stefytorus: ah
[27.08.2020 15:54:41] BlockWorksYT: hey stef
[27.08.2020 15:56:15] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 16:06:55] Stefytorus: d
[27.08.2020 16:42:03] Stefytorus: ok
[27.08.2020 16:42:07] Stefytorus: music on join is done
[27.08.2020 16:42:22] Stefytorus: there is a cooldown on interacting with jukeboxes
[27.08.2020 16:42:27] Stefytorus: ranks need tested
[27.08.2020 16:42:33] Stefytorus: ./help and /rules done
[27.08.2020 16:43:15] Stefytorus: and crates are tested but we should double-check
[27.08.2020 16:43:21] BlockWorksYT: lets do it :)p
[27.08.2020 16:44:05] BlockWorksYT: so once opened the chest dissapears
[27.08.2020 16:44:07] BlockWorksYT: when does it reappear?
[27.08.2020 16:44:15] Stefytorus: did you open it/
[27.08.2020 16:44:16] Stefytorus: ?
[27.08.2020 16:44:18] BlockWorksYT: yeah
[27.08.2020 16:44:24] BlockWorksYT: I just saw one over here dissapear
[27.08.2020 16:44:26] Stefytorus: one will spawn each minute
[27.08.2020 16:45:22] BlockWorksYT: hmm the compass on the head
[27.08.2020 16:45:30] BlockWorksYT: new players might not see it as it's not in the inventory
[27.08.2020 16:45:39] BlockWorksYT: can we change it to the first slot of inventory?
[27.08.2020 16:45:46] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 16:45:57] Stefytorus: would off-hand work?
[27.08.2020 16:46:24] BlockWorksYT: yeah maybe, bit annoying though
[27.08.2020 16:46:28] BlockWorksYT: takes up quite a lot of hte screen
[27.08.2020 16:46:29] Stefytorus: k, first slot then
[27.08.2020 16:46:49] BlockWorksYT: where does the compass point if there are no disc crates?
[27.08.2020 16:46:58] BlockWorksYT: spawn
[27.08.2020 16:47:16] BlockWorksYT: and what's the loot tables like?
[27.08.2020 16:47:22] BlockWorksYT: we need to bear in mind some of the discs aren't custom
[27.08.2020 16:47:28] BlockWorksYT: we only have 9 original discs
[27.08.2020 16:47:32] BlockWorksYT: so the crates should only offer those ones
[27.08.2020 16:48:17] Stefytorus: let me test the compass now
[27.08.2020 16:48:58] BlockWorksYT: love the music
[27.08.2020 16:49:24] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 16:49:27] Stefytorus: double-checked
[27.08.2020 16:49:32] Stefytorus: Discs are the 9 custom ones
[27.08.2020 16:49:44] BlockWorksYT: :)
[27.08.2020 16:50:12] BlockWorksYT: weird
[27.08.2020 16:50:13] Stefytorus: did you open it?
[27.08.2020 16:50:19] BlockWorksYT: didn't see it
[27.08.2020 16:50:27] Stefytorus: yeah, that's strange
[27.08.2020 16:50:36] Stefytorus: need to find out why
[27.08.2020 16:51:57] BlockWorksYT: no luck with this crate either
[27.08.2020 16:52:20] Stefytorus: i think they may be broken
[27.08.2020 16:52:21] Stefytorus: fixing
[27.08.2020 16:53:38] BlockWorksYT: nice work on this :)
[27.08.2020 16:53:44] BlockWorksYT: you're good with tight deadlines
[27.08.2020 16:54:02] BlockWorksYT: which is how this team mostly works haha
[27.08.2020 16:54:47] Stefytorus: I'm used to it :)
[27.08.2020 16:54:52] BlockWorksYT: haha nice
[27.08.2020 16:54:55] BlockWorksYT: ok final meeting of the day
[27.08.2020 16:55:03] BlockWorksYT: gtg, but after we can come finish up - it looks great
[27.08.2020 16:55:06] BlockWorksYT: i'll add more holos at spawn
[27.08.2020 16:55:06] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 16:55:07] BlockWorksYT: other than that
[27.08.2020 16:55:12] BlockWorksYT: maybe just refine the loot tables
[27.08.2020 16:55:16] BlockWorksYT: get some potions etc in there
[27.08.2020 16:55:19] Stefytorus: sure
[27.08.2020 16:55:20] BlockWorksYT: mobs spawning
[27.08.2020 16:55:22] BlockWorksYT: etc.
[27.08.2020 16:55:28] Stefytorus: mobs spawning aren't really useful
[27.08.2020 16:55:31] BlockWorksYT: lets have the day night cycle
[27.08.2020 16:55:32] Stefytorus: since they can't damage
[27.08.2020 16:55:36] BlockWorksYT: aha
[27.08.2020 16:55:43] BlockWorksYT: can we turn on mob damage from hostiles
[27.08.2020 16:55:47] BlockWorksYT: so there's a survival element at night?
[27.08.2020 16:55:51] Stefytorus: yep
[27.08.2020 16:55:52] BlockWorksYT: just make it a bit more interesting
[27.08.2020 16:55:59] BlockWorksYT: then some armour, weapons, arrows etc. in the crates
[27.08.2020 16:56:04] Stefytorus: good idea
[27.08.2020 16:57:36] BlockWorksYT: kk, catch you later!
[27.08.2020 16:57:39] Stefytorus: ok
[27.08.2020 16:57:39] BlockWorksYT: i'llb e doen in 30 mins
[27.08.2020 17:33:46] BlockWorksYT: hey!
[27.08.2020 17:33:48] Stefytorus: hi
[27.08.2020 17:34:34] BlockWorksYT: how's it going?
[27.08.2020 17:34:43] Stefytorus: working on crates
[27.08.2020 17:35:26] Stefytorus: should crates glow?
[27.08.2020 17:36:15] BlockWorksYT: oh yes please :)
[27.08.2020 17:36:26] Stefytorus: i think when they are down they shouldn't
[27.08.2020 17:36:31] BlockWorksYT: looks abit weird now
[27.08.2020 17:36:33] Stefytorus: yeah
[27.08.2020 17:36:36] Stefytorus: transparency
[27.08.2020 17:36:37] BlockWorksYT: getting strange graphics effects
[27.08.2020 17:36:41] BlockWorksYT: but it was good before!
[27.08.2020 17:37:21] Stefytorus: let me change it
[27.08.2020 17:38:23] Stefytorus: one thing i don't understand is why the crates don't get removed
[27.08.2020 17:40:19] Stefytorus: here we go
[27.08.2020 17:41:05] Stefytorus: any server icon to set?
[27.08.2020 17:42:03] Stefytorus: did you take the crate?
[27.08.2020 17:42:07] BlockWorksYT: nope
[27.08.2020 17:42:10] BlockWorksYT: searching now
[27.08.2020 17:42:22] BlockWorksYT: found it
[27.08.2020 17:42:26] Stefytorus: ah
[27.08.2020 17:42:37] BlockWorksYT: we need to wait till its on ground right?
[27.08.2020 17:42:43] Stefytorus: you can take it in the air too
[27.08.2020 17:42:47] BlockWorksYT: btw how quickly can we open up a new server if we reach max limit
[27.08.2020 17:42:58] Stefytorus: a hour
[27.08.2020 17:43:02] BlockWorksYT: kk
[27.08.2020 17:43:05] BlockWorksYT: good to know
[27.08.2020 17:43:10] BlockWorksYT: we might want to do that - up to client
[27.08.2020 17:43:16] BlockWorksYT: can't open :(
[27.08.2020 17:43:21] Stefytorus: but that means changing the domain too
[27.08.2020 17:43:32] BlockWorksYT: pushes back and hurts me
[27.08.2020 17:43:34] BlockWorksYT: even with key
[27.08.2020 17:43:50] Stefytorus: hworks for me
[27.08.2020 17:45:08] Stefytorus: let's see now
[27.08.2020 17:45:09] Stefytorus: reloaded
[27.08.2020 17:46:30] Stefytorus: click to open
[27.08.2020 17:46:33] Stefytorus: left click
[27.08.2020 17:46:47] BlockWorksYT: aaah left click
[27.08.2020 17:46:50] BlockWorksYT: i was righ-clicking
[27.08.2020 17:46:52] Stefytorus: let me make it both
[27.08.2020 17:46:54] Stefytorus: so it's more intuitive
[27.08.2020 17:46:58] BlockWorksYT: loot was jumping potion but wouldn't let me take it
[27.08.2020 17:47:04] BlockWorksYT: 'you can't remove your magic items'
[27.08.2020 17:47:10] Stefytorus: that also needs fixed, 1 sec
[27.08.2020 17:47:20] BlockWorksYT: ok stef I think this is great. If you can fix out crate issues I think we're ready :)
[27.08.2020 17:47:30] BlockWorksYT: I'll add some holos at spawn this evening
[27.08.2020 17:47:38] BlockWorksYT: is the cooldown on jukeboxes working?
[27.08.2020 17:51:07] Stefytorus: should be
[27.08.2020 17:51:09] Stefytorus: it ex
[27.08.2020 17:51:13] Stefytorus: it is based on owner
[27.08.2020 17:51:19] Stefytorus: so the owner shouldn't have the cooldown
[27.08.2020 17:51:22] Stefytorus: we need to test
[27.08.2020 17:53:56] Stefytorus: here we go
[27.08.2020 18:04:34] BlockWorksYT: stef
[27.08.2020 18:04:37] BlockWorksYT: lewis can't open crates
[27.08.2020 18:04:55] Stefytorus: let's tp to the crate
[27.08.2020 18:06:20] Stefytorus: click to open
[27.08.2020 18:06:34] BlockWorksYT: no disc :(
[27.08.2020 18:06:49] Stefytorus: ah, there's a set chance for the disc to show up
[27.08.2020 18:06:53] Stefytorus: do you want me to make it 100%?
[27.08.2020 18:10:04] Stefytorus: here we go, now you should be able to right click crates too
[28.08.2020 08:37:30] NewNoise88: Mountain club printworks vibes.

[28.08.2020 08:41:03] NewNoise88: Not sure the music is?
[28.08.2020 08:41:09] BlockWorksYT: ok
[28.08.2020 08:41:16] BlockWorksYT: do you have music turned on in your settings?
[28.08.2020 08:41:30] NewNoise88: yeah
[28.08.2020 08:41:38] NewNoise88: If I joined early, would it have cached?
[28.08.2020 08:41:51] BlockWorksYT: and you loaded the resource pack that the server asked you to?
[28.08.2020 08:42:08] NewNoise88: I think so,
[28.08.2020 08:42:16] BlockWorksYT: can you hear that?
[28.08.2020 08:42:21] NewNoise88: I can.
[28.08.2020 08:42:33] NewNoise88: Is that one of our supplied tracks or just Minecraft?
[28.08.2020 08:42:37] BlockWorksYT: if you try re-logging, you should hear the backing soundtrack as soon as you're in
[28.08.2020 08:42:46] NewNoise88: Came up as "now playing csomething cat"
[28.08.2020 08:42:58] NewNoise88: And haven't heard the backing track yet.
[28.08.2020 08:43:07] BlockWorksYT: hmm might need to re-log
[28.08.2020 08:43:18] NewNoise88: My homer simpson skin also doesn't seem to have a head.
[28.08.2020 08:43:21] NewNoise88: But that's my problem.
[28.08.2020 08:43:32] NewNoise88: How do I reload it all?
[28.08.2020 08:43:34] BlockWorksYT: this is one of the supplied tracks! should come up with the title, not C14
[28.08.2020 08:43:41] BlockWorksYT: If you press escape, disconnect
[28.08.2020 08:43:44] BlockWorksYT: then log back in
[28.08.2020 08:44:16] BlockWorksYT: working?
[28.08.2020 08:44:25] NewNoise88: Nothing playing at the mo.
[28.08.2020 08:44:41] NewNoise88: Ah no, still minecraft soundtrack.
[28.08.2020 08:44:47] BlockWorksYT: yeah definitely have music turned on in the sounds and settings?
[28.08.2020 08:44:49] NewNoise88: Shall I remove the server and re-add?
[28.08.2020 08:44:52] BlockWorksYT: you*
[28.08.2020 08:45:08] BlockWorksYT: also what minecraft version are you using?
[28.08.2020 08:45:13] NewNoise88: 1.12.2
[28.08.2020 08:45:23] NewNoise88: That's what I needed for the test server.
[28.08.2020 08:45:41] BlockWorksYT: so it should still work, but we updated the server so that players with the latest version (1.16) could play
[28.08.2020 08:45:50] NewNoise88: Cool, let me try that.
[28.08.2020 08:45:53] BlockWorksYT: can you try re-logging with a 1.16.1 version
[28.08.2020 08:49:51] Dibsy: Whaddup whaddup whaddup.

[29.08.2020 06:23:20] 1999cam2: No clue.
[29.08.2020 06:23:37] 1999cam2: I found a chest with some stuff in it on the surface but thats it lol.
[29.08.2020 06:23:49] McCoy_115: I'm at a hot seven keys.
[29.08.2020 06:24:03] McCoy_115: Found a club but there's nothing in it :v.
[29.08.2020 06:24:31] 1999cam2: Was the entrance hidden in the water somewhere or?
[29.08.2020 06:24:49] McCoy_115: I'm in the tundra atm.
[29.08.2020 06:25:03] McCoy_115: 1139 66 121
[29.08.2020 06:25:25] 1999cam2: Any idea what the totems are for?
[29.08.2020 06:25:34] McCoy_115: Probably just regular loot to fight mobs.
[29.08.2020 06:28:25] McCoy_115: Diamond sword thoo.
[29.08.2020 06:28:36] McCoy_115: Lmao @ the sentence case.
[29.08.2020 06:33:42] 1999cam2: Bit lost.
[29.08.2020 06:33:46] McCoy_115: aye.
[29.08.2020 06:33:53] 1999cam2: Compass leads to here but theres nothing.
[29.08.2020 06:34:01] McCoy_115: I think it's pointing to spawn.
[29.08.2020 06:34:05] 1999cam2: Ahh true.
[29.08.2020 06:34:13] 1999cam2: That makes sense im *****ed.
[29.08.2020 06:34:37] McCoy_115: But if jukeboxes are the record boxes or something, nothing is even happening when I click them :v.
[29.08.2020 06:35:07] McCoy_115: So the jukeboxes are used to play the discs.
[29.08.2020 06:35:22] McCoy_115: Not an absolute idea where the record crates are supposed to be found.
[29.08.2020 06:35:38] 1999cam2: It mentions up there that the disc crates fall, maybe its a timed thing?
[29.08.2020 06:35:52] 1999cam2: Like every half hour they fall down to the map idk.
[29.08.2020 06:36:03] McCoy_115: I hope not, it's 2:35 for me lmao.
[29.08.2020 06:36:16] 1999cam2: Ahh rip lol.
[29.08.2020 06:36:23] McCoy_115: I just wanted to check this out before bed.
[29.08.2020 06:36:30] McCoy_115: And it's just key crates.
[29.08.2020 06:36:43] 1999cam2: Yeah not a whole lot of direction on what to do hey.
[29.08.2020 06:38:17] McCoy_115: Is this like.. Done?
[29.08.2020 06:38:25] 1999cam2: Seems a bit broken.
[29.08.2020 06:38:40] McCoy_115: The compass just points to spawn no matter where you are.
[29.08.2020 06:39:04] McCoy_115: Probably could have used a little more playtesting lole.
[29.08.2020 06:39:15] 1999cam2: Yeah for sure.
[29.08.2020 06:40:45] McCoy_115: Bad news jowsh.

[29.08.2020 13:18:31] BlockWorksYT: 50% chance from a crate :)
[29.08.2020 13:18:42] sukuno: Well my compass always shows the same place.

[29.08.2020 13:20:11] Sambe6: A leaderboard?
[29.08.2020 13:21:06] BlockWorksYT: exp doesn't really do anything, but we can add some enchanting tables
[29.08.2020 13:21:21] TheBlackElias: Wait so ur an admin.

[29.08.2020 13:22:01] BlockWorksYT: i'm not a dev though, and not very good with perms
[29.08.2020 13:22:10] TheBlackElias: ahha
[29.08.2020 13:22:12] BlockWorksYT: the keys will open the disc crates (once they start falling)
[29.08.2020 13:22:29] sukuno: I guessed you are even just with the "blcokworks" name, want to say the map is insane ☺
[29.08.2020 13:22:34] BlockWorksYT: thanks!
[29.08.2020 13:22:37] byKaRenXs: When they start falling?
[29.08.2020 13:22:40] Sambe6: Yeah its incredible.

[29.08.2020 13:23:05] byKaRenXs: Ok thanks.
[29.08.2020 13:23:06] BlockWorksYT: you'll want to get as many keys as you can - one key opens one crate
[29.08.2020 13:23:10] BlockWorksYT: and there are 9 discs to find
[29.08.2020 13:23:22] TheBlackElias: Wait did u help build the uncensored lib?

[29.08.2020 13:28:57] BlockWorksYT: it will be quicker to use /spawn and fly from there most times
[29.08.2020 13:29:05] Sambe6: Can you die and keep the stuff you have?
[29.08.2020 13:29:17] Stefytorus: yep

[30.08.2020 11:17:01] Saxumos: Where is a disc crate to put the key in?
[30.08.2020 11:17:19] ell33ex: Still looking for one too.
[30.08.2020 11:17:23] Saxumos: ah
[30.08.2020 11:17:48] ell33ex: The compas only points to spawn.
[30.08.2020 11:31:23] zweetzourzuznik: Is there any disc crate here atm ?
[30.08.2020 11:31:41] ell33ex: I rly dont think so ive been looking for awhile.
[30.08.2020 11:31:56] zweetzourzuznik: Hm aight.
[30.08.2020 11:31:56] Saxumos: Maybe they're working on it.
[30.08.2020 11:32:46] ell33ex: Maybe they release them one at a time.
[30.08.2020 11:32:53] ell33ex: Not sure how it works.
[30.08.2020 11:34:23] Saxumos: Did you do that?
[30.08.2020 11:34:39] zweetzourzuznik: What?
[30.08.2020 11:34:42] Saxumos: nvm
[30.08.2020 11:34:53] Saxumos: You got a disc.
[30.08.2020 11:35:14] zweetzourzuznik: Yeah, i've got more.
[30.08.2020 11:35:22] Saxumos: Found in chests?
[30.08.2020 11:35:49] zweetzourzuznik: No, in disc crates. But you need keys to open them, which you can find in regular chests.
[30.08.2020 11:36:18] Saxumos: I have a lot of keys but left clicking a disc crate doesn't work at spawn.
[30.08.2020 11:37:03] zweetzourzuznik: hm
[30.08.2020 11:37:34] ell33ex: Those are where u put the discs.

[30.08.2020 11:38:29] ell33ex: Im only finding jukeboxes.
[30.08.2020 11:39:05] zweetzourzuznik: The disc crates are not the jukeboxes. You need your compass to find disc crates, but apparently there ren't any atm. Maybe it's a bug or smthn idk.
[30.08.2020 11:39:22] ell33ex: Oooh ok got it thanks.

[30.08.2020 15:05:58] Jordaaaaaan: Sometimes they get stuck in the sky.
[30.08.2020 15:06:14] jakblu: I think it may be if you come into the world your compass doesnt point towards it.
[30.08.2020 15:06:25] jakblu: Because it has already dropped.
[30.08.2020 15:06:35] RaphaP3: The compass is actually pointing to the spawn.
[30.08.2020 15:06:41] jakblu: Yeh its bugged.

[31.08.2020 11:23:45] CommunityMC: I really enjoyed it! A nice spin with some boppers. It's fairly well rounded.

[31.08.2020 12:55:53] craftrudge: Sooo is the server broken or something?
[31.08.2020 12:56:09] GarmentMaestro: Has anyone found the caves.
[31.08.2020 12:56:32] Shlevin: Not sure.. I just found a club-like zone but nothing going on there..
[31.08.2020 12:56:48] craftrudge: Nothing hoing on in any of the clubs.
[31.08.2020 12:58:18] craftrudge: But for real, is the server broken? All the chests are empty, and there isnt dropping any crates.
[31.08.2020 12:58:45] craftrudge: Compas just leads you to spawn.
[31.08.2020 12:58:51] craftrudge: Compas just leads you to spawn.
[31.08.2020 12:59:06] Shlevin: Ye just found an empty one as well. Compass indeed just points to spawn..
[31.08.2020 12:59:26] craftrudge: Chests sometimes are supposed to be empty.
[31.08.2020 12:59:35] craftrudge: But all ive opened today has been empty.
[31.08.2020 13:00:11] craftrudge: Never mind, just found a key in a chest.
[31.08.2020 13:21:31] GarmentMaestro: Is there a club in the kitchen.
[31.08.2020 13:32:23] Willem1998: Does the other player in the game know how this works?
[31.08.2020 13:33:03] Willem1998: Because my "magical compass" shows the center off the map and nothing else.
[31.08.2020 13:33:41] Willem1998: Can you chat?
[31.08.2020 13:33:45] Shlevin: sec
[31.08.2020 13:36:15] Shlevin: Server seems to be bugged somehow.
[31.08.2020 13:36:25] Willem1998: You think?
[31.08.2020 13:36:27] Shlevin: Magic compass points to spawn.
[31.08.2020 13:36:34] Willem1998: jep
[31.08.2020 13:36:35] Shlevin: Only found empty crates so far.
[31.08.2020 13:36:40] Shlevin: Hype music though.
[31.08.2020 13:36:42] Willem1998: Me too.
[31.08.2020 13:38:20] yosempai: Yep my compass glitched since last night.
[31.08.2020 13:38:36] yosempai: I believe mods have been notified....
[31.08.2020 13:38:36] Willem1998: But the server worked fine untill then?
[31.08.2020 13:38:53] yosempai: I've been on 4 times and it was working once.
[31.08.2020 14:10:34] teeho123: Yo is there anything ur meant to do.
[31.08.2020 14:11:23] Yajax: Eyo I think you have to find keys to create disks and play them on jukebox on clubs.
[31.08.2020 14:11:33] Yajax: On chests.
[31.08.2020 14:11:47] Shlevin: Where dem keys at yo?!
[31.08.2020 14:12:31] Yajax: I have some in chests at the north of the face.

[31.08.2020 14:15:32] teeho123: Not sure if it's my lag.
[31.08.2020 14:16:18] Yajax: Some chests have nothing but if you can't, that's not normal.
[31.08.2020 14:16:30] Yajax: Music makes me lag a bit btw.

[01.09.2020 16:58:50] snowmang42: So right now there's a record crate out there somewhere. Seems that after a while the compass stops pointing to it.
[01.09.2020 16:59:07] snowmang42: Last time this happened I randomly found the record crate sitting there.
[01.09.2020 16:59:13] snowmang42: So explore like crazy I guess.
[01.09.2020 16:59:14] Nootalia: I'm just trying to follow the magic compass atm.

[01.09.2020 16:59:52] snowmang42: Yeah kinda sucks, but I guess one of the main points is to explore anyhow.
[01.09.2020 17:00:34] Kidd59: Hoz lol.
[01.09.2020 17:00:40] snowmang42: Anybody want a sword or something?

[01.09.2020 17:08:00] snowmang42: But if you play when crates are not dropping you don't make too much progress.
[01.09.2020 17:17:56] Nootalia: When do the crates drop?

[02.09.2020 15:07:15] snowmang42: No the keys are in the chests.
[02.09.2020 15:07:20] snowmang42: Keys open dropped crates.
[02.09.2020 15:07:40] snowmang42: If a dropped crate sits for too long. Compasses don't show the way there anymore and they get 'lost'
[02.09.2020 15:07:43] Keylocke: There is nothing at the spot.
[02.09.2020 15:07:46] snowmang42: So it's a big treasure hunt right now.
[02.09.2020 15:07:54] Mianite: Big treasure hunt!
[02.09.2020 15:08:00] mimo8888: Fun!!
[02.09.2020 15:08:02] Keylocke: My compass is pointing to nothing.
[02.09.2020 15:08:03] snowmang42: With no help from compasses.
[02.09.2020 15:08:09] snowmang42: There is a crate sitting out there somewhere.
[02.09.2020 15:08:14] Keylocke: No there aint.
[02.09.2020 15:08:21] snowmang42: Yes. Yes there is.
[02.09.2020 15:08:23] CloudF11: Does it look like a regular chest?
[02.09.2020 15:08:24] PriestPry: Ive found many crates.
[02.09.2020 15:08:26] snowmang42: I have experienced this before.
[02.09.2020 15:08:28] Keylocke: Theres NOTHING at the spot.
[02.09.2020 15:08:32] snowmang42: ffs
[02.09.2020 15:08:37] snowmang42: COMPASS NOT WORKING NOW!
[02.09.2020 15:08:42] mimo8888: Maybe someone already got this crate.
[02.09.2020 15:08:43] snowmang42: There is a crate sitting out there.
[02.09.2020 15:08:46] snowmang42: Lol no.
[02.09.2020 15:08:50] snowmang42: Another would spawn.
[02.09.2020 15:08:57] Keylocke: Great.
[02.09.2020 15:08:59] snowmang42: Once a crate is found and opened a new one spawns.
[02.09.2020 15:09:02] snowmang42: Drops ***
[02.09.2020 15:09:04] mimo8888: ohh
[02.09.2020 15:09:08] Keylocke: Yeah well it didnt lol.
[02.09.2020 15:09:16] snowmang42: So the only way to get this going again is to go find the missing record crate!!!
[02.09.2020 15:09:19] snowmang42: Trust me.
[02.09.2020 15:09:24] CloudF11: I'll go elsewhere then and quit wasting my time, lol.
[02.09.2020 15:09:26] snowmang42: I've been playing for a few days now.
[02.09.2020 15:09:28] CloudF11: Let's see.
[02.09.2020 15:09:28] snowmang42: Hahaha.
[02.09.2020 15:09:35] snowmang42: More people would make this easier.
[02.09.2020 15:09:39] claire17: So do we get hints?
[02.09.2020 15:09:43] snowmang42: If we all band up and help, we can get this going again.
[02.09.2020 15:09:54] snowmang42: No but there's a command to message the admins.
[02.09.2020 15:10:00] Skopernyte: Hiiii.

[02.09.2020 15:10:14] CloudF11: Yeah I have two also.
[02.09.2020 15:10:21] Keylocke: How do you even get keys???
[02.09.2020 15:10:26] snowmang42: No idea if anybody reads those, but maybe if enough people type /helpop and explain the issue, maybe it will get fixed? Lol for the 2 more days that this thing will run.
[02.09.2020 15:10:28] StellarLuma: This server is so heckin cool.
[02.09.2020 15:10:33] snowmang42: Keys are in chests.
[02.09.2020 15:10:38] snowmang42: Hidden around the landscape.
[02.09.2020 15:10:42] snowmang42: I am your sage here.
[02.09.2020 15:10:44] Keylocke: W h a t c h e s t s.

[02.09.2020 15:11:38] mimo8888: Has anyone found the priest yet tho?
[02.09.2020 15:11:39] ERR0R_403: Also can i just say this map is amazing.

[02.09.2020 15:12:33] Keylocke: Can it be literally anywhere.
[02.09.2020 15:12:45] snowmang42: Totally, anywhere on the map. Somewhere on the ground probably.
[02.09.2020 15:12:53] Keylocke: Thats going to take a while.
[02.09.2020 15:12:54] snowmang42: Make sure you have a crate key if you find it hahah.
[02.09.2020 15:12:55] Geminisun: I was very confused when music started playing-
[02.09.2020 15:12:57] snowmang42: yep!
[02.09.2020 15:13:05] Keylocke: I havent seena single chest.

[02.09.2020 15:13:21] claire17: So uh what do i need to know again?
[02.09.2020 15:13:21] Keylocke: Erm
[02.09.2020 15:13:23] snowmang42: Once you find a chest you'll start to see where and how they hide them and they will get easier to find.
[02.09.2020 15:13:29] Keylocke: So I found a key chest and it was empty.
[02.09.2020 15:13:31] Keylocke: Love that.
[02.09.2020 15:13:33] Casanoble: I have a key but don't know how to use it.

[02.09.2020 15:16:24] Keylocke: Do keys spawn in caves?
[02.09.2020 15:16:36] snowmang42: No compasses work right now.

[02.09.2020 20:20:28] oswaldhowbiz: Hello there!
[02.09.2020 20:20:36] Textona: hey
[02.09.2020 20:22:46] oswaldhowbiz: How you doing?
[02.09.2020 20:22:52] Textona: Whats the point of this.
[02.09.2020 20:23:22] oswaldhowbiz: Apparently you should look for chests all around the map.
[02.09.2020 20:23:31] Textona: My compass doesnt point to them though.
[02.09.2020 20:23:39] oswaldhowbiz: I
[02.09.2020 20:23:46] oswaldhowbiz: I've just found one.
[02.09.2020 20:23:53] Textona: lol
[02.09.2020 20:23:55] Textona: Check this out.
[02.09.2020 20:23:58] oswaldhowbiz: I think the compass is pointing to the jukebox.
[02.09.2020 20:24:08] Textona: Lol you can die.
[02.09.2020 20:24:13] Textona: You can die lol.
[02.09.2020 20:26:34] oswaldhowbiz: I don't think it is working.
[02.09.2020 20:26:52] oswaldhowbiz: Apparently that crate doesn't work.
[02.09.2020 20:29:45] oswaldhowbiz: Hello to the people joining!
[02.09.2020 20:29:51] NoahNorrod: hi!
[02.09.2020 20:29:57] Textona: Its really boring ngl.
[02.09.2020 20:31:15] Textona: Especially since the features straight up don't work.
[02.09.2020 20:31:37] oswaldhowbiz: This was an weird idea.
[02.09.2020 20:31:38] Textona: Half of the chests I find are empty.
[02.09.2020 20:31:51] Textona: I cant use the keys.
[02.09.2020 20:31:57] Textona: The compass just points to spawn.
[02.09.2020 20:32:04] Textona: And to fly, you have to go to spawn everytime.
[02.09.2020 20:32:34] oswaldhowbiz: At least we can listen to Disclosure in background.
[02.09.2020 20:34:57] Textona: Cool map, but the server lacks anything that would make me want to keep playing 2/10
[02.09.2020 20:35:03] NoahNorrod: It's a temp thing anyway.
[02.09.2020 20:35:13] NoahNorrod: Iirc they're shutting it down friday.
[02.09.2020 20:35:27] oswaldhowbiz: Yes, thats what the page said.
[02.09.2020 20:35:54] oswaldhowbiz: Maybe it'd be better as an survival map when they enable the option to download it.
[02.09.2020 20:36:01] NoahNorrod: Ooh that would be interesting.
[02.09.2020 20:36:09] NoahNorrod: Survival on this map would be fun.
[02.09.2020 20:36:27] oswaldhowbiz: Indeed.
[02.09.2020 20:38:22] oswaldhowbiz: It's a shame keys don't work.
[02.09.2020 20:38:45] oswaldhowbiz: We'll have to wait until the enable a download link then.
[02.09.2020 20:39:11] oswaldhowbiz: See you people, stay safe! ❤
[02.09.2020 20:52:03] NoahNorrod: Smh the compass really does just lead back to spawn.
[02.09.2020 20:52:06] NoahNorrod: You hate to see it.
[02.09.2020 20:52:22] NoahNorrod: How do i even get up there?
[02.09.2020 20:54:25] NoahNorrod: Well i guess i just have these two disc crate keys but no disc crate to use em on.
[02.09.2020 21:01:11] N1PPL3N1CK: I return.

[03.09.2020 17:40:01] brucejhenry: Guys kitchen.
[03.09.2020 17:45:30] brucejhenry: Rate this one the most.
[03.09.2020 17:45:51] iROEZz: Only reason im on here is to hear the unreleased stuff.
[03.09.2020 17:46:00] brucejhenry: same
[03.09.2020 17:46:07] brucejhenry: I really hope the release the uhhuh song.
[03.09.2020 17:46:49] iROEZz: Wish theyd just do like an unreleased playlist on soundcloud or something.
[03.09.2020 17:49:13] brucejhenry: Hopefully but their label probs stops them from doing that.
[03.09.2020 17:49:40] iROEZz: Exactly i can understand why they dont probs a lot of business stuff.
[03.09.2020 17:49:56] brucejhenry: Yeah most artists just gotta do what the label says which sucks.
[03.09.2020 17:50:17] iROEZz: You been on the twitch streams.
[03.09.2020 17:50:21] brucejhenry: yeah
[03.09.2020 17:50:24] iROEZz: Been loving the tunes theyre making on those.
[03.09.2020 17:50:34] brucejhenry: Yeah wish i could produce so i could enter the remix comp.
[03.09.2020 17:51:08] iROEZz: Ikr i want to buy a macbook just to start trying to make a few songs lol inspired.
[03.09.2020 17:51:20] iROEZz: I already have decks just could never be bothered with production.
[03.09.2020 17:51:23] brucejhenry: Same tbf logic looks way better than ableton.
[03.09.2020 17:51:29] brucejhenry: Same i would go on fl on and off.
[03.09.2020 17:51:37] brucejhenry: Like make 1 song then not touch it for years on end.
[03.09.2020 17:51:48] brucejhenry: But im really tempted to save for a macbook and learn logic.
[03.09.2020 17:52:31] iROEZz: I got abelton on my laptop but atm my laptop just isnt quick enough to do production.
[03.09.2020 17:52:44] brucejhenry: I gotta get it on my laptop so i can take it around.
[03.09.2020 17:52:59] iROEZz: Would probs end up financing a macbook pay it monthly and switch to logic.
[03.09.2020 17:53:16] brucejhenry: Yeah my sis managed to get a macbook i think it was around 100 a month which isnt bad.
[03.09.2020 17:53:25] brucejhenry: Just got no job atm so kinda hard for me.
[03.09.2020 17:53:30] brucejhenry: Otherwise i would.
[03.09.2020 17:54:19] brucejhenry: But logic just looks so easy to learn tbh only thing ill miss from fl is the step sequencer.
[03.09.2020 17:54:56] iROEZz: Yeah it does look nice on their streams logic.
[03.09.2020 17:55:04] iROEZz: Yeah it does look nice on their streams logic.
[03.09.2020 17:55:32] iROEZz: Yeah it does look nicer on their streams logic.
[03.09.2020 17:56:03] brucejhenry: Yeah fl is nice ableton i think just looks disgusting and like they said if youre going to be looking at it all day.
[03.09.2020 17:56:07] brucejhenry: It better look nice.
[03.09.2020 17:57:17] iROEZz: Exactly think it all comes down to personal pereference innit and logic to me looks cleaner.
[03.09.2020 17:58:46] brucejhenry: Yeah i mean ive wanted to try logic for ages.
[03.09.2020 17:58:55] brucejhenry: Fl is alright for me but my laptops so old.
[03.09.2020 17:59:02] iROEZz: Loool this is their twitch one class.
[03.09.2020 17:59:04] brucejhenry: So its an excuse to get a new one.
