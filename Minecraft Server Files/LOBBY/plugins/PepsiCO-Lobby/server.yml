  # How it works:
  # The builder is allowed to build the pallet and attempt to send it.
  # When he clicks the button, the order can either go through (and record the time it took for that to happen)
  # or it can be denied. If it is denied, explain the reasons. In this case, we will consider defects, unplaced blocks,
  # as defects, so only a perfect pallet (counted blocks = required blocks) will go through.
  #
  # Game: Give player the required blocks and allow him to place the pallet. Once built and verified, he wil progress to the next layer.
  # This way, he will learn the ENTIRE process required in the factory.
